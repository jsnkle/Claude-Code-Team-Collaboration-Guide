# Part 11: Checkpoints & Recovery

Claude Code automatically captures snapshots before each edit, providing a safety net for developers. Team members can use `Esc + Esc` or `/rewind` to restore code, conversation, or both to any checkpoint.

**Team Relevance:** This built-in feature requires no configuration but is worth mentioning during onboarding so developers know they can experiment safely.

For full details, see the [official checkpointing documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/checkpointing).
