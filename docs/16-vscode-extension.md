# Part 14: VS Code Extension

The Claude Code VS Code extension provides a graphical interface alternative to the CLI.

## Key Features

- **LSP Code Intelligence**: Go-to-definition, find references, and hover documentation powered by Language Server Protocol
- Inline diffs and plan mode
- Native IDE integration

## Team Relevance

Project `.claude/` configurations (rules, commands, agents, settings) work identically in both the CLI and extension. Teams can standardize on either interface - the configuration is shared.

For installation and feature details, see the [official VS Code extension documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs).
