# Frontend Development Rules

<!-- TODO: Customize React patterns for your project -->

## React Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components under 200 lines
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic

## State Management
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Use context for shared UI state
- Use React Query for server state

## Performance
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Use useCallback for function props
- Lazy load routes and heavy components
- Avoid inline object/array creation in JSX

## Accessibility
- All images need alt text
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen reader

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Extract repeated patterns to components
- Follow mobile-first approach
